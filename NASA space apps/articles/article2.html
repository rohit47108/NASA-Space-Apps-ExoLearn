    <h1>The Classification of Exoplanets</h1>

    <section id="section1">
        <p>An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system, unlike the planets in our own solar system. These distant worlds exist in the vast reaches of space, often hundreds or thousands of light-years away from Earth. Exoplanets come in various sizes, compositions, and orbital patterns, making them diverse and difficult to classify using traditional methods used for our solar system planets.</p>
        <div class="question">
            <label for="question1">What is an exoplanet?</label><br>

    <section id="section2" class="hidden">
        <p>The discovery of exoplanets depends on several advanced detection techniques, with the most common being the transit method and radial velocity. The transit method identifies planets when they pass in front of their host star, causing a slight dimming of the star’s light. The radial velocity method detects the tiny wobble in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. These methods allow scientists to find exoplanets that are invisible to the naked eye.</p>

    <section id="section3" class="hidden">
        <p>Exoplanets are classified into several types based on their size, mass, and temperature. Some of the common types include gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn, which are massive planets with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. There are also rocky planets, similar to Earth, that may have solid surfaces, and ice giants, which contain large amounts of icy materials. Each type represents a different composition and environmental condition, contributing to their varied classification.</p>

    <section id="section4" class="hidden">
        <p>Exoplanets are often grouped by their size and mass relative to the planets in our solar system. For example, super-Earths are planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, while mini-Neptunes are planets that are smaller than Neptune but still have thick atmospheres. Gas giants like Jupiter are the largest, and Earth-sized or smaller rocky planets are classified as terrestrial planets. This system of classification helps scientists predict what kind of environment might exist on each exoplanet.</p>

        <p>The distance between an exoplanet and its host star significantly impacts its classification, especially in terms of habitability and temperature. Planets that are too close to their stars may be too hot to sustain liquid water, while those that are too far away might be too cold. Exoplanets in the "habitable zone" are considered the most likely to support life because they could have liquid water. Distance also influences whether the planet is classified as a "hot Jupiter," "warm Neptune," or "cold super-Earth."</p>

        <p>Atmospheres play a critical role in classifying exoplanets, as they give clues about the planet's composition, potential weather patterns, and habitability. Some exoplanets have thick atmospheres filled with gases like hydrogen and helium, which are typical of gas giants. Others may have thinner, more Earth-like atmospheres with nitrogen and oxygen. Studying the atmosphere can reveal whether a planet has clouds, storms, or even the potential for life, which further refines its classification.</p>

        <p>One of the most exciting aspects of exoplanet classification is the potential for habitability. Scientists are particularly interested in planets that lie within the "habitable zone" of their star, where conditions might allow for liquid water—an essential ingredient for life as we know it. Classifying exoplanets based on their ability to support life helps researchers prioritize which planets to study further in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
