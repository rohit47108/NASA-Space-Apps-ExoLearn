    <h1>Exoplanets: A Hope For Another Earth</h1>

    <section id="section1">
        <p>Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Scientists have discovered thousands of these planets through various methods, including observing the dimming of a star's light when a planet passes in front of it. This discovery has opened up a new field of study focused on the potential for life beyond Earth. Understanding what exoplanets are is the first step in investigating their potential for supporting life.</p>
